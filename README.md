## Linear Regression 
<p>
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a widely used technique for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.

The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that represents the linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. This line is called the regression line, and it is defined by the equation:  
`y = mx + b` where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept.

Linear regression can be used for both simple and multiple regression, depending on the number of independent variables used in the model. It is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, biology, and social sciences to predict future outcomes and understand the relationship between variables.

## Clustering
<p>
Clustering is a technique in data mining and machine learning used to group together similar objects or data points based on their characteristics or attributes. The goal of clustering is to divide a set of data points into groups or clusters such that points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to points in other clusters.

There are many clustering algorithms available, but some of the most commonly used are k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering.

In k-means clustering, the algorithm partitions the data into a pre-defined number of clusters, where each cluster is represented by its centroid or mean. The algorithm iteratively moves data points between clusters to minimize the distance between the data points and the centroids of their respective clusters.
